# Handwriting2Text

Handwriting2Text is a machine learning project aimed at converting handwritten text into digital text using a neural network trained on the ResNet34 architecture. This project can recognize handwritten text drawn with a mouse, digital pen, or fingers on a screen, similar to the Scribble function found in Apple products.

The project utilizes the TensorFlow 2.0 library to implement and train the ResNet34 neural network from scratch, enabling it to recognize individual handwritten letters. Additionally, it employs the OpenCV (cv2) library to extract the characters drawn in a canvas.

To deploy the Handwriting2Text project, the Flask framework is used as the web application framework, along with CSS, HTML, and vanilla JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. The interface allows users to draw letters and numbers on a digital canvas, and the neural network then recognizes and converts the handwritten characters into digital text.

Overall, the Handwriting2Text project is an innovative solution that combines machine learning techniques with web development technologies to create a powerful handwriting recognition tool. It has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, such as note-taking apps, educational platforms, and communication tools.
